# Day 2 - Practice Problems, Experiments, Addition, and Multiplication: 

Today is simply practice day. We went through Classical Probability so we know what we're at least starting with. Each question will introduce something new. So, working through these should be useful, I hope!

## <a id="formulas"></a>Formulas

There are so many formulas for Probability. I found a reasonable example of them at:

And the cheat sheet is below:

## <a id="1"></a>Classical Probability - Throwing Axes

I am throwing axes at the local axe throwing bar. My friends and I begin betting and decided to base a multiplier of our throws as the probability of an event occurring. 

If I throw an axe at numbers 1-12 (S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}), what is the probability I will hit an even number?

How do we approach this?

## <a id="2"></a>Classical Probability - Selecting a Tribute

It is the apocalypse and we are trying to rebuild society. Each year, we select a person from each region to represent that region in the games. Given random selection of 30,000 men and 39,000 women, what is the probability than the selected tribute will be a man?

## <a id="3"></a>Experimental vs Classical - Dice

Roll a die 28 times and record your roles. 
(If you don't have dice, please go here:
http://www.randomservices.org/random/apps/Dice.html)

Place those data in here: 

|Dice Face|Result|
|---------|------|
|1||
|2||
|3||
|4||
|5||
|6||
|7||

On a theoretical, perfect die, what is the probability to roll a 5?

On your die you have rolled, what is the probability to roll a 5?

## <a id="4"></a>Experimental vs Classical - Coins

Flip a coin 27 times and record your results. Be consistent with what you call heads and tails.

|Coin Face|Result|
|---------|------|
|Heads||
|Tails||

What is the probability of your coin that i'll roll a Tails?

## <a id="5"></a>Experimental - MOBA Characters

I am looking for a new character to play in a MOBA. There are 52 available characters. Looking at their capabilities, we can list them out. 
* 16 are offense.
* 17 are support.
* 15 are for mid/Jungle.
* 12 Are Gimmicks.

Of this, we can additionally state that: 
* 5 is Offense but can do suport.
* 3 is a gimmick and mid.

If I ask the game to select 1 of these, what is the probability that the game chooses 1 that is offense or a support?

## <a id="6"></a>Complement of a Set - Passing

There is an 87% chance that a student will pass this class. What is the likelihood that a student will fail? Please provide your answer in a complete sentence explaining why you made the choice you did as well as showing your work.

For example, "Given an 87% chance of passing, we would expect to use the complement of the set to answer this question or the formula XXXX. With that in mind, the math of this is (formula + math answer here)."

## <a id="7"></a>Complement of a Set - 7-sided Die

I have a 7-sided die. We can assume that each face on the die has an equal chance to be rolled. If I roll the dice, what is the probability of rolling a 5 or a 7? What is its complement? 

State your answers in percentages and then show me a verifcation of your answer.

## <a id="8"></a>Experimental - Colors and a 4-Sided Die

|Color | Number of Results |
|------|-------------------|
|Brown|21|
|Orange|10|
|Green|13|
|Yellow|26|

Given the above results, what is the experimental probability of spinning the color Orange?

## <a id="9"></a>Addition Rules - Sticky Hands

So this came from CodeAcademy and it's amazing so i'll paste it in here: 

![Addition Rule](/images/add-rule.gif)

In a bag, there are a huge number of sticky hands - those rubber strings with a hand on the end. Inside the bag, there are 24 blue hands and 21 Orange Hands. Of those, 9 of the blue hands and and 14 of the orange hands are skeletal. If we reach into the bag and pick up 1 hand at random, what is the probability of choosing an Orange Hand OR a Skeletal Hand.

## <a id="10"></a>Addition Rules - Mutual Exclusivity

For this approach, we need to think about what it means to be mutually exclusive. Remember this: 

![Mutually Exclusive](/images/mup.png)

So think about this, we have a 16-sided die. If I roll that die, what is the probability of rolling a 15 or a 7? Why did you calculate it that way?

How do we approach this? What is the Solution?

## <a id="11"></a>Multiplication Rules - Joint Probability + Dependence

I have 3 decks of traditional playing cards. Each deck consists of 4 of each card from Ace to King. Each card is split into 4 suits (Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, and Clubs) and 2 colors (red and black).

Through the discussion of Dependence, think about the formula. What is P(F|E). 

If I combine all of the cards together, what is the probability I would draw a Face Card? And then without replacing that card, what is the probability I would draw a a 9?

## <a id="12"></a>Multiplication Rules - Joint Probability + Independence

A study of students in undergraduate stats courses found the probabilities that a student will fail the course for the following reasons. 

|Probabilities of Failing a Stats Course|
|Reason|Probability|
|------|-----------|
|Attendance under 70%|.1356|
|Did not read outside of class|.2478|
|Thinks they know better and acts on it|.1026|
|Caught Cheating|.1954|
|Majority of assignments late or not submitted|.3186|

What is the probability that a student fails stats for Attendance under 70%, Caught Cheating, and that the majority of assignments late or not submitted?
