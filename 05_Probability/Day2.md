# Day 2 - Practice Problems, Experiments, Addition, and Multiplication: 

Today is simply practice day. We went through Classical Probability so we know what we're at least starting with. Each question will introduce something new. So, working through these should be useful, I hope!

## <a id="formulas"></a>Formulas

There are so many formulas for Probability. I found a reasonable example of them at: 

https://medium.com/data-comet/probability-rules-cheat-sheet-e24b92a9017f

And the cheat sheet is below:

## <a id="1"></a>Classical Probability - Throwing Axes

I am throwing axes at the local axe throwing bar. My friends and I begin betting and decided to base a multiplier of our throws as the probability of an event occurring. 

If I throw an axe at numbers 1-12 (S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}), what is the probability I will hit an even number?

How do we approach this?

## <a id="2"></a>Classical Probability - Selecting a Tribute

It is the apocalypse and we are trying to rebuild society. Each year, we select a person from each region to represent that region in the games. Given random selection of 30,000 men and 39,000 women, what is the probability than the selected tribute will be a man?

How do we approach this?

## <a id="3"></a>Experimental vs Classical - Dice

Roll a die 28 times and record your roles. 
(If you don't have dice, please go here:
http://www.randomservices.org/random/apps/Dice.html)

Place those data in here: 

|Dice Face|Result|
|---------|------|
|1||
|2||
|3||
|4||
|5||
|6||
|7||

On a theoretical, perfect die, what is the probability to roll a 5?

On your die you have rolled, what is the probability to roll a 5?

## <a id="4"></a>Experimental vs Classical - Coins

Flip a coin 27 times and record your results.

|Coin Face|Result|
|---------|------|
|Heads||
|Tails||

## <a id="5"></a>Experimental - MOBA Characters

I am looking for a new character to play in a MOBA. There are 52 available characters. Looking at their capabilities, we can list them out. 
* 16 are offense.
* 17 are support.
* 15 are for mid/Jungle.
* 12 Are Gimmicks.

Of this, we can additionally state that: 
* 5 is Offense but can do suport.
* 3 is a gimmick and mid.

If I ask the game to select 1 of these, what is the probability that the game chooses 1 that is offense or a support?

How do we approach this?

## <a id="6"></a>Complement of a Set - Passing

There is an 87% chance that a student will pass this class. What is the likelihood that a student will fail? Please provide your answer in a complete sentence explaining why you made the choice you did as well as showing your work.

For example, "Given an 87% chance of passing, we would expect to use the complement of the set to answer this question or the formula XXXX. With that in mind, the math of this is (formula + math answer here)."

## <a id="7"></a>Complement of a Set - 7-sided Die

I have a 7-sided die. We can assume that each face on the die has an equal chance to be rolled. If I roll the dice, what is the probability of rolling a 5 or a 7? What is its complement? 

State your answers in percentages and then show me a verifcation of your answer. 

## <a id="8"></a>Experimental - Colors and a 4-Sided Die

|Color | Number of Results |
|------|-------------------|
|Brown|21|
|Orange|10|
|Green|13|
|Yellow|26|

Given the above results, what is the experimental probability of spinning the color Orange?

## <a id="9"></a>Addition Rules - Sticky Hands

So this came from CodeAcademy and it's amazing so i'll paste it in here: 

![Addition Rule](/images/add-law.gif)

In a bag, there are a huge number of sticky hands - those rubber strings with a hand on the end. Inside the bag, there are 24 blue hands and 21 Orange Hands. Of those, 9 of the blue hands and and 14 of the orange hands are skeletal. If we reach into the bag and pick up 1 hand at random, what is the probability of choosing an Orange Hand OR a Skeletal Hand.

How do we approach this?

## <a id="10"></a>Addition Rules - Mutual Exclusivity

For this approach, we need to think about what it means to be mutually exclusive. Remember this: 

![Mutually Exclusive](/images/mup.png)

So think about this, we have a 16-sided die. If I roll that die, what is the probability of rolling a 15 or a 7?

How do we approach this?
