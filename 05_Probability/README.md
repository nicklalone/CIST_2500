# Probability and Statistics

From your textbook, it introduces this section in the following ways: 

1. What are the chances that sales will decrease if we increase prices?
2. What is the likleihood a new assembly method will increase productivity? 
3. How likely is it that the project will be finished on time?
4. What is the chance that a new investment will be profitable?

Your book then goes on to define the word probability by saying: 

> probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. 

To understand probability, we will be going through a number of exercises. Please find the table of contents below: 

[Day 1](#day1):
1. [Experiments: a coin toss](#experiments)
2. [Counting Rules, Combinations, and Permutations - Dealing with multi-step experiments.](#counting)
3. [Assigning probabilities.](#assigning)
4. [Addition Law](#addition)
5. [Conditional Probability.](#conditional)

[Day 2](#day2): 
1. [Discrete Probability Distributions](#probdis)
2. [Uniform Probability Distributions](#uniprob)
3. [Normal Probability Distributions](#normprob)
4. [Exponential Probability Distributions](#exponent)
