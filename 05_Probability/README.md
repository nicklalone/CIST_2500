# Probability and Statistics

From your textbook, it introduces this section in the following ways: 

1. What are the chances that sales will decrease if we increase prices?
2. What is the likleihood a new assembly method will increase productivity? 
3. How likely is it that the project will be finished on time?
4. What is the chance that a new investment will be profitable?

Your book then goes on to define the word probability by saying: 

> probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. 

To understand probability, we will be going through a number of exercises. Please find the table of contents below: 

Day 1:

1. Experiments: a coin toss
2. Counting Rules, Combinations, and Permutations - Dealing with multi-step experiments.
3. Assigning probabilities.
4. Addition Law
5. Conditional Probability.

Day 2: 
1. Discrete Probability Distributions
2. Uniform Probability Distributions
3. Normal Probability Distributions
4. Exponential Probability Distributions
