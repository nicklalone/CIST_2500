## <a id="whatmean"></a>What do we mean, "Descriptives?"
In week 1, I mentioned the 3 big hats that we can wear when it comes to statistics. For reference, those "hats" are: 
* Describe
* Compare
* Relate
When we gather data of any kind, we will probably have an idea of what we're going to do with the data in order to make it information; however, we still need to "describe" those data.

The most important concept to carry forward from this week is this: 

	The centrality, the shape of your data will often determine what sorts of tests *can actually be performed* on said data.
