# Welcome!
In week 1, I mentioned the 3 big hats that we can wear when it comes to statistics. For reference, those "hats" are: 
* Describe
* Compare
* Relate
When we gather data of any kind, we will probably have an idea of what we're going to do with the data in order to make it information; however, we still need to "describe" those data. But describe how? What does that even mean? Well, that's what we're going to explore.

The shape of data is deceptive. 

The most important concept to carry forward from this week is this: 

	The centrality, the shape of your data will often determine what sorts of tests *can actually be performed* on said data. 

This will probably not make a huge amount of sense until we get into actual inferences, but just keep it in mind for now.

In general, we will only be using arthimetic mean in this class; however, it's good to know that the others exist. These are covered in your textbook but I find [(this article from the NIH to be super useful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3127352/#:~:text=Mean%20is%20the%20most%20commonly,and%20harmonic%20mean%20(HM).).

* arithmetic mean


* weighted mean
Weighted mean is calculated when certain values in a data set are more important than the others. A weight wi is attached to each of the values xi to reflect this importance.

* geometric mean 
* harmonic mean
