Mean: $\bar{x} \ or \mu = \frac{\Sigma{x}}{n}$ 
Median: $\frac{N+1}{2}$
Mode: Is simply the most repeated number. 

These should be the 3 formula you need for today.

## <a id="excel"></a>Getting Excel Up and Running
For the most part, there's just one link to worry about. That link is this: 

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-analysis-toolpak-in-excel-6a63e598-cd6d-42e3-9317-6b40ba1a66b4#OfficeVersion=Windows

The Data Analysis Toolkit / Tool Pack is super useful. You may tell yourself that you can get away with never using this and you might, but the tradeoff is to do more work, manually, than you have to. The tradeoff is up to you.

## <a id="ts"></a>Test Scores
Every test, homework, assignment, quiz, or other kind of skill check is useful for understanding a few different things. For example, if the scores are all low, then looking more into the questions that were missed the most can be useful to see if it was your lectures or the outside reading that matters. If the test is super high, then either you're doing a good job or you're not pushing your students hard enough but this is a delicate thing so it can be tricky to get right. 

As a rule of thumb, for this sort of question we can make a few assumptions though these are not really relevant to this question, they can be helpful to know as students: 
1. New Faculty are often brutal
2. Grad Students teaching classes are often more brutal than New Faculty and I should go on to say that if you ever hear the words, "peer grading" know that if students are grading you that more often than not, you will be destroyed.
3. Middle Career faculty will tend to be reasonably balanced but skew toward too easy because they feel bad about their early brutalness or they're trying to pump up their review scores.
4. End of career faculty are wildcards and it mostly depends on if they enjoy teaching or not. 

Data from Test 1: 
85, 95, 42, 80, 100, 100, 100, 85, 67, 10, 78, 54, 99, 100, 85, 85, 85, 66, 42, 69, 87, 85, 85, 99, 20

We need to get these data into Excel and so let's try that out.

We also need to get some summary statistics, let's try those out.

## <a id="hp"></a>House Prices
House prices will tend to influence how people perceive a neighborhood. And so, we are going to start an analysis of home prices in a neighborhood...somewhere?

130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;250,000;873,879;450,000;234,000;132,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;133,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 147,000; 357,000; 365,999;130,500; 145,000; 259,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 367,999;250,400;873,879;451,000;234,000;130,000; 145,000; 57,000; 368,999;130,700; 145,000; 257,000; 367,999;130,000; 145,000; 157,000; 360,999;130,300; 145,000; 257,000; 360,989;130,000; 145,000; 457,000; 360,999;258,500;873,879;450,000;234,000;25,000;

We need to get these data into Excel and so let's try that out.

We also need to get some summary statistics, let's try those out.

## <a id="st"></a>Speedrun Times
I really enjoy watching folks speedrun games and lately, i've been enamored with Ninja Gaiden 2 which is a game I worked really hard at beating when I was a kid and was the first game I ever finished. 

The world record of this game can be found at: https://www.speedrun.com/ng2nes?h=Any&x=vdo4e92p

The current times I have achieved are: 
00:14:54,00:12:24,00:24:51,00:34:04,00:15:14,00:19:34,00:40:04,00:24:24,00:34:19,00:19:15,00:30:59,00:22:22,00:18:16,00:16:00,01:12:14,00:54:04,00:24:18,00:29:34,00:22:33
