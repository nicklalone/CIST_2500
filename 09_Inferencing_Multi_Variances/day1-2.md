# Chapter 10 - Inferences about Means and Proportions with Two Populations

Up until this chapter, we have been primarily concerned with the test statistics applied to a single population. This is a powerful concept and one that affords us the capacity to make very wide-reaching assertions and inferences about populations. 

And yet, humans are complex and if we've learned anything over COVID, that complexity can be overwhelming. 

In this section, we're going to concern ourselves with interval estimates about 2 populations. There are tests for more than 3, but that is beyond the scope of the class.

For the most part, we've basically been nailing this down to 3 specific instances: 

1. Inferences with population parameters known.
1. Inferences with only sample statistics.
1. Inferences with only proportions.

That trend continues.
