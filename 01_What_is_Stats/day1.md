# Welcome!

Statistics is a name given to a collection of tests, concepts, and calculations that folks have been performing as far back as the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.–220 A.D.). 

You may say to yourself, "Oh god, why's he talking about history?" And to this i'll say that this isn't a history class, but a statistics course. We will *always* use history to predict the future. 

And so what?

Well, the so what of statistics is that we can use this to determine the likelihood that you as a person will succeed in life. We can know the likelihood that you'll get a disease in some circumstances. Or, we can know about how long you'll live, how well your local economy is going, and more.

All of these things about you, in the present, are based on those things we know about all those folks who came before you. So, we can say that statistics is the use of the past to predict the future which is currently the present. 

Weird, right?!

Statistics is used almost everywhere these days. From home loans to discount cards to machine learning to artificial intelligence to finding the proper ratios and proportions for beers, sports teams, and video games, statistics is a universal practice.

And we're going to pull back all of the fantasy around all of that and get into the reality.

## <a id="who"></a>Who I am
Dr. Nick LaLone is a first generation researcher of the socio-technical at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His research interests include social network analysis, emergency management, Disaster Science, Play, Games, and the sociology of race, gender and ethnicity. He has presented at ACM Conferences like CHI, DIS, and CSCW and is a current program committee chair for ISCRAM, the FEMA Higher Education Symposium, and the Conference Planning Committee of the international Association of Emergency Management (IAEM). 

Nick’s research focuses on how emergency managers understand and use technology, how play and games factor into that technology integration, and how location-based services need to be developed to better assist emergency managers in the midst of a response. Recent publications include a discussion of, “The Technology Crisis in US-based Emergency Management: Toward a Well-Connected Future” at HICSS earlier this month which came as the result of a long-asked question about how emergency management understands technology. He highlighted that regardless of any and all education, age, or socio-economic background, the bulk of emergency management understands and uses technology in the same way, they do not use it at all. He is currently engaged in the development of trainings, policy, and white papers that will engage this issue and hopefully foster a new tech industry focused on use-cases in the midst of disaster. 

While at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Nick has been teaching (online and in-person) core courses focused on introductory statistics, management, and how technology works. In the past, Nick has developed an successful Data Science Masters Program for a small online University in Omaha, taught introductory programming to people who have never touched their computers with the intent to code before, and introductions to game design and game programming using the PICO-8 fantasy game console. 

In his spare time, Nick can be found writing and reading everything he can find, playing low-stress video games like Chained Echoes, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Stardew Valley, designing socially awkward games no one should play, and helping new game designers find the resources and audience they need. In addition to these things, Nick is recovering from an achilles tendon injury or he would be continuing with his partner Kristen (a veterinarian) to prepare for marathons, ultra marathons, and other kinds of sporting things no one in their right mind should do. When not doing any of the above, he can be found searching for early relics in the creation of Dungeons and Dragons as part of a research team for a series of documentaries.

## <a id="how"></a>How the class works
There are 1000 points in class. We gather them in one of the following ways: homeworks, tests, and analyses. Analyses will almost all use R. The distribution of points:

|item|#|points per|point total| overall total | \% of total|
|-|-|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
|Homeworks|10|30|300|300|30\%|
|Tests|4|100|400|700|40\%|
|Analysis|3|100|300|1000|30\%|

### Homework
It's obnoxious but the key to figuring out math stuff is to do math stuff. I know this is a surprise. So what we will do each week is a collection of exercises from the relevant readings of that week. As your textbook gives you half of the answers, each of you should begin at a 50\% meaning all you can do is go up! There are 14 homeworks in 16 weeks of class but also 3 tests meaning that 13 weeks are available. Well, let me tell you a secret...you all get a free 20 points for homeworks. And what this means is that there's actually 12 homeworks...

### Tests
Ah, tests. Each test will be open-note, open-book, and you can ask me questions about the questions if you're stuck. You may say after reading this, ``oh man, this'll be easy!`` But open-note, open-book, also means that I can make the questions as hard and weird as I want to. Will I follow through on that threat?  We will see.

### Analyses
Because I am a mean person, you have to actually perform a few analyses. These analyses will be of real datasets. The first will use Excel but the last 2 will use R. Mostly what you'll do here is either answer questions I ask you OR (especially in the later part of the course) identify something you'd like to know and then do it. These will be done in a small essay format. 5 paragraphs, just tell me what you see.

## <a id="learn"></a>What you'll know how to do

## <a id="geta"></a>How to get an A
It's really pretty simple. I will do everything I can to protect you from me, from the college, and from yourselves. However, I can't be everything and so for you, in order to get an A you need to:

1. Come to Class.
2. Participate.
3. Ask questions. 
4. Take responsibility for your future.

If you fail this course or get less than an A, that is because you did not do one of the above.
