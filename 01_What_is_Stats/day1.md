# Welcome!

Statistics is a name given to a collection of tests, concepts, and calculations that folks have been performing as far back as the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.â€“220 A.D.). 

You may say to yourself, "Oh god, why's he talking about history?" And to this i'll say that this isn't a history class, but a statistics course. We will *always* use history to predict the future. 

And so what?

Well, the so what of statistics is that we can use this to determine the likelihood that you as a person will succeed in life. We can know the likelihood that you'll get a disease in some circumstances. Or, we can know about how long you'll live, how well your local economy is going, and more.

All of these things about you, in the present, are based on those things we know about all those folks who came before you. So, we can say that statistics is the use of the past to predict the future which is currently the present. 

Weird, right?!

Statistics is used almost everywhere these days. From home loans to discount cards to machine learning to artificial intelligence to finding the proper ratios and proportions for beers, sports teams, and video games, statistics is a universal practice.

And we're going to pull back all of the fantasy around all of that and get into the reality.
