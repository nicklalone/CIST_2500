# Welcome!

Statistics is a name given to a collection of tests, concepts, and calculations that folks have been performing as far back as the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.â€“220 A.D.). 

You may say to yourself, "Oh god, why's he talking about history?" And to this i'll say that this isn't a history class, but a statistics course. We will *always* use history to predict the future. 

And so what?

Well, the so what of statistics is that we can use this to determine the likelihood that you as a person will succeed in life. We can know the likelihood that you'll get a disease in some circumstances. Or, we can know about how long you'll live.

All of these things about you, in the present, are based on those things we know about all those folks who came before you. So, we can say that statistics is the use of the past to predict the future which is currently the present. 

Weird, right?!
