# CIST_2500 - Introduction to R.

# Getting Started
We produce data far more than we produce waste and the gap between the amount of data and amount of trash we are creating is only getting further apart. In order to help us with the sheer amount of data we've produced, there are a number of products out there to help. 

Among those packages, we can highlight the following: 

1. SPSS - Statistics Package for Social Sciences
2. Stata - 
3. SAS
4. R

And you can see where they all reside at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKPaHH7hnv8&ab_channel=DataDaft

So for this class, we're going to learn a few commands. Nothing drastic this week as I don't want to scare everyone away (yet). 

## Basics and Overview

One of the things we will be doing in this class is taking a tour of the world of "R." This programming language has grown in popularity over the years because of a ton of support, ease of use, its nature as an open-source product, and its power. R, at its core, will reward you should you decide to learn how to use it as it is a skill that will open doors for you. 

That said, its nature as an open source product is as such that it can be dense, almost impossible to really *get* when you first open it up. What's more, there are literally millions of videos about how R functions and not a single one of them begins with the same content, uses the same packages to get started, or even acknowledges that there are other ways of doing things. 

For this initial exposure, we will be doing some *extreme basics* in the form of: 

1. [Loading Packages](#packages)
2. [Loading Data](#loading)
3. [Poking around the Summarytools Package](#summarytool)
4. [Working on Z-Scores](#zscore)
5. [Appending columns of information to your data](#appending) 
6. [Data Filtering](#filter)
7. [Loading and doing tutorials](#tutorial)

But first things first. We need to install R. This requires that you install 2 things (4 on Macs). 

For starters, we will go to CRAN (the comprehensive R Archive Network) and download the base package of R. That will be found at: https://cran.r-project.org/

Now, what this thing from CRAN you just downloaded is is basically an interpreter and the base language. We can use it but since we're new, we probably should find something a little easier to deal with. 

With that in mind, let's go to step 2: R-Studio. This package is located at: https://www.rstudio.com/

You will need the desktop version for your operating system. *Do not pay for it, just get the free version* 

**For Mac Users:** if you're on a mac, you need to do 2 more steps. These steps are just things for R to use in the background. It will not influence your machine in any way outside of this. 

1. Open up your terminal (click the magnifying glass in the upper right and type ``terminal`` and it should show up). Once you're there, type the following command ```xcode-select --install``` and let it run until its done. That is step one! If you really *need* to know, Xcode is the software development toolkit for macs. It is no longer installed by default. 

2. You need to install a program called, Xquartz which is located at: https://www.xquartz.org/. Just download the most recent .dmg or package and install it. This project essentially allows you to deal with the various windows in R-Studio. You can read more about what xquartz is, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System

And so we're up and running! Let's take a bit of a tour. You should see 4 panes (maybe 3, but the 4th will show up after you load data):

1. (Upper Left) - This is the pane you might not see yet. It is the data pane and it lets you click on and explore your data. In addition, you can do some rudimentary filtering with this window. If you are working in a variety of datasets, it will show them in a variety of tabs in that window. 

2. (Upper Right) - This is what we can call your "environment" window or pane. Here, you will see a whole lot of stuff. From left to right, Environment is where you will see what data is loaded into memory. These will be noticable from the blue arrow to the left of the name that, once clicked, will give you some basics about your data. Clicking on the actual name will show it on the data pane. 

Next to environment, there is a pane called, "History" which is what you think it is. To the right of History, there is "Connections" which is primarily used for very large datasets and data repositories. Finally, we see the tutorial pane. Initially, the tutorial pane requires
