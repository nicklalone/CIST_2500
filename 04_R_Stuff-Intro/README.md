# CIST_2500 - Introduction to R.

# Getting Started
We produce data far more than we produce waste and the gap between the amount of data and amount of trash we are creating is only getting further apart. In order to help us with the sheer amount of data we've produced, there are a number of products out there to help. 

Among those packages, we can highlight the following: 

1. SPSS - Statistics Package for Social Sciences
2. Stata - 
3. SAS
4. R

And you can see where they all reside at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKPaHH7hnv8&ab_channel=DataDaft

So for this class, we're going to learn a few commands. Nothing drastic this week as I don't want to scare everyone away (yet). 

## Basics and Overview

One of the things we will be doing in this class is taking a tour of the world of "R." This programming language has grown in popularity over the years because of a ton of support, ease of use, its nature as an open-source product, and its power. R, at its core, will reward you should you decide to learn how to use it as it is a skill that will open doors for you. 

That said, its nature as an open source product is as such that it can be dense, almost impossible to really *get* when you first open it up. What's more, there are literally millions of videos about how R functions and not a single one of them begins with the same content, uses the same packages to get started, or even acknowledges that there are other ways of doing things. 

For this initial exposure, we will be doing some *extreme basics* in the form of: 

1. [Loading Packages](#packages)
2. [Loading Data]()
3. [Poking around the Summarytools Package]()
4. [Working on Z-Scores]()
5. [Appending columns of information to your data]() 
6. [Data Filtering]()
7. [Loading and doing tutorials]()
