# Getting Started
We produce data far more than we produce waste and the gap between the amount of data and amount of trash we are creating is only getting further apart. In order to help us with the sheer amount of data we've produced, there are a number of products out there to help. 

Among those packages, we can highlight the following: 

1. SPSS
2. Stata
3. SAS
4. R

```does this work?```
