# CIST_2500
A collection of lectures, exercises, and resources for an introduction to statistics. 

This week includes chapter 10 which mostly concerns itself with interval estimates of two populations. This collection of tests essentially allows us to compare 2 samples that are essentially matched (i.e. two sections of the same course, two neighborhoods in the same town, and other such populations).
