# Week 7 - Sampling and Sampling Things - Day 2 - Intervals
On Tuesday, we got into sampling methods and point estimations as we move from samples to making inferences about populations. Today, we're going to close the loop and work off of intervals.

## <a id="InEs"></a>Interval Estimation

We talked on Tuesday about Point Estimates. This is a way for us to really start to hone in on population parameters as we work on taking more and more samples. How we take samples, the consequences of those methods, and other aspects of those things will always have to be something we take account of. This is what makes statistics so frustrating to teach. No one sample is ever the same, no one sample ever has the same issues, and no one sample will ever look like what you're doing, what i'm doing, or what someone else does. Even if we're working on the same datasets, our outcomes may differ slightly due to these approaches. 

For interval estimates, this is how we begin to take into account the infinite variance of what we're doing and rather than offer a specific point where our estimates reside, we are instead offering a margin where they could reside. Your book defines this as: 

> An estimate of a population parameters that provides an interval believed to contain the value of a parameter. For the interval estimates in this chapter, it has the form: (point estimate ± margin of error).

### <a id="conf"></a>Confidence Intervals

What this tends to do is offer you a level of accuracy you can associate with your calculated measures. How confident you are is based on what amounts to 1 of 3 levels. 

|Confidence Level|α|α<sup>2</sup>|z<sub>α/2</sub>|
|----------------|-|---|---------------|
| 90 |.10|.05|1.645|
| 95 |.05|.025|1.960|
| 90 |.01|.005|2.576|
