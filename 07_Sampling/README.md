# Week 7 - Sampling and Sampling Things
We have been exploring conceptual data and a variety of concepts in and around the philosophy of statistical inference. Now that we have explored how to explore the shape of our data, let's move a little further in to look within that shape and to compare it to the expected shape of the standard normal curve. 

You may ask yourself how and why such a thing matters. This is a good question.

It matters for basically 1 reason, without the laws in and around the normal curve, all of frequentist statistics couldn't be trusted. 

There are implications for this. 1. We can predict human activities to a certain extent. 2. To predict those things, we need to have a critical mass of data. 3. Our samples have issues but as long as we mind those issues, we can make inferences about human activity (or whatever we're collecting data about).

Since samples are so important, we're going to spend some time adding some new ideas. 

Every single time we take a sample and use it to understand a population, we're making estimates, we're doing probabilities. Everything begins with 2 things: 
1. What is the experiment?
1. What is our sampling approach?

In this section of class, we're going to concentrate not on the experiment, but on the sampling approach. We need to learn approaches to collecting data so that we can learn approaches to writing hypotheses we can solve with those sampling methods.

# <a id="pe"></a>Point Estimation

One of the easiest ways to describe this concept is to use a different definition of the same thing: central tendency. 

Do you remember calculating all of the modes of central tendency? Mean, Median, Mode? These are all estimates of population parameters.

Why? What? Huh?
