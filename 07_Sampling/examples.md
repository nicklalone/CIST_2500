For the following, you will need these formulas.

Each of these should be relatively straight forward but I will mark what formula goes where. You can refer to the thursday notes for a bit more context in addition to chapter 7&8.

<a id="InEs"></a>Interval Estimation

Here, we're going to walk through some questions in order to get our head on correctly.

<a id="popk"></a>CI with σ Known

Compute the standard error of the mean, given the folloowing values for σ and n. 
* σ = 25, n = 4
* σ = 99, n = 49
* σ = 62, n = 50
* σ = 75, n = 25

Given the following: 
x̅ = 150, σ = 12, n = 25
	* Estimate the mean of the population by constructing a 95% confidence interval.
	* Estimate the mean of the population by constructing a 99% confidence interval.

The mean for the verbal component of the SAT is reported as 500, with a standard deviation (σ) of 100. A sample of 900 students throughout a particular school district reveals a mean (x̅) score of 522. Estimate the mean score for all the students in the district, using a 95% confidence interval.

## <a id="popunk"></a>CI with σ unknown

Estimate the standard error of the mean given the folliwing values for s (sample standard deviation) and n (sample size).
* s = 5, n = 16
* s = 12.5, n = 25
* s = 18.25, n = 50
* s = 35.5, n = 30

Given the following: 
x̅ = 402, s = 110, n = 30
	* Estimate the mean of the population by constructing a 95% confidence interval.
	* Estimate the mean of the population by constructing a 99% confidence interval.

A sample of 25 participants in a parenting skills class are administered a test to measure their skill levels on a 200 point skills test before entering the class. Results indicate that the mean (x̅) skill level for the sample is 86, with a standard deviation of (s) of 12. Based on that information, develop a 95% confidence interval to provide an estimate of the mean skill level for the entire population of program participants. 

## <a id="iepp"></a>Confidence Interval Problems for a Proportion

Of a sample of 150 customers at a local bank, 15% report that they are likely to request a bank loan within the next year. Using a 99% confidence interval, estimate the percentage likely to request a loan within the population of all customers. 

An opinion poll based on responses from a sample of 250 community residents indicates that 61% are in favor of a local civic redevelopment project. Estimate the level of support throughout the community based on a 95% confidence interval. 

A poll based on a national sample of 1200 potential voters and focused on attitudes toward social security reform indicates that 73.55% of the respondents oppose a proposal that would extend the minimum retirement age. Using a 95% confidence interval, estimate the proportion of opposition throughout the population of potential voters.
