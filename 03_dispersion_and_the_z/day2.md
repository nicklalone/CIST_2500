Another way to think about this week is how we begin to move from description to inferences.

## <a id="formulas"></a> Formulas
* **Mean**: $\bar{x} \ or \mu = \frac{\Sigma{x}}{n}$ 
* **Median**: $\frac{N+1}{2}$
* **Mode**: Is simply the most repeated number. 
* Variance / Standard Deviation: 
	* **Population** = $\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma(X-\mu)^2}{N}$ whereas Standard Deviation is: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X-\mu)^2}{N}}$
	* **Sample** = $s^2 = \frac{\Sigma(X-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ whereas Standard Deviation is: $s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$

## <a id="ts"></a> Example 1: Quiz Scores
Since we are mostly working with just numeric data, we will keep using test scores because it is the easiest type of data for us to get our head around given where we are.

Data from a Quiz: 
2, 30, 40, 30, 20, 80, 80, 80, 84, 98, 100, 100, 100, 100, 78, 66, 98, 54, 44, 90, 90, 90, 88, 86, 84, 82, 54, 90, 44, 66, 44, 90, 90, 88, 2, 90, 44

What's the Variance? What's the Standard Deviation? Let's do a few z-scores.

166, 123, 188, 122, 124, 126, 156, 167, 174, 188, 180, 168, 144, 168, 180, 188, 198, 146, 188, 166, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 166, 151, 152, 180, 200, 100, 156, 157

## <a id="speed"></a>Example 3: Speeds
Every time i'm on I-80, I get to witness a bunch of folks in cars that shouldn't be on the road going at speeds beyond what they should be capable of. So, let's look at the impact of these speed demons on the standard deviation of speeds on I-80.

80, 82, 84, 65, 87, 98, 96, 94, 78, 88, 98, 110, 120, 67, 65, 45, 87, 76, 64, 90, 43, 76, 88, 112, 122, 67, 96, 99, 100, 104, 103, 80, 82, 84, 65, 87, 98, 96, 94, 78, 88, 98, 110, 120, 67, 65, 45, 87, 76, 64, 90, 43, 76, 88, 112, 122, 67, 96, 99, 100, 104, 103, 8082 84 65 87 98 96 94 78 88 98 110 120 67 65 45 87 76 64 90 43 76 88 112 122 67 96 99 100 104 103
