Today, we have 2 goals: 
1. Refactor, Filter, and deal with issues related to data cleaning in R.
1. Do CHI-Square Tests in R, Append Crammer's V, and export those results to a csv.

At its most basic, the χ² test allows us to test if a specific variable derived by a sample is accurate representing a population. It tests this assertion by calculating the data we would expect to be there.

Remember that there are 2 rules to remember for χ²:
1. Expected values are calculated with the assertion that H<sub>o</sub> is true
1. While you are seeking a relationship, the math provides us with a variety of ways variables relate mathematically. You can use another measure to understand the impact.
