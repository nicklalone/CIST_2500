# Hypothesis Testing - Tests and t-tests

In chapters 7 and 8 (last week), we did some work in and around expanding our toolkit. However, we don't really have anything to put all of our tools into. As a result, we have a giant mess to think about. 

We have all this data sitting around. It's raw, it is untamed, and yet all we can do is explore, poke around. 

Well, that is about to change.

## <a id="tails"></a> Let's talk about Tails

Let's say we have a questionaire that measures levels of religious participation (scores out of 100). Assume we've collect3e scores from a sample of urban residents and a sample of rural residents. 

We have information from two samples (urband and rural), and we have a mean for each group (66.45 for the urban residents and 79.27 for the rural residents). Let's also assume that we've already calculated an estimate of the standard error (4.42). This test situation is appriopriate for a difference of means test for independent samples -- one in which we'd eventually calculate a t-value for the difference of means. You'll recall that part of the t-test procedure requires that we find the difference between the two means, which we'll eventually divide by the estimate of the standard error of the difference of means to obtain our calculated test statistic. In reality, it isn't important how we go about finding the difference. We can subtract the mean of the rural residents from the mean of the urban residents; or, we can approach the problem in the opposite fashion, subtracting the mean of the urban residents from the mean of the rural residents.
