# Hypothesis Testing - Ho's and Ha's 

In chapters 7 and 8 (last week), we did some work in and around expanding our toolkit. However, we don't really have anything to put all of our tools into. As a result, we have a giant mess to think about. 

We have all this data sitting around. It's raw, it is untamed, and yet all we can do is explore, poke around. 

Well, that is about to change.

## <a id="gs"></a> Getting Started

So at this point, we've essentially fiddled with every piece of information you could imagine. Raw scores, we've looked at means, medians, modes, and done what amounts to some exploratory analysis. We've basically been playing some catch or kicking the ball back and forth. 

It's time now to learn the sport we're going to play and *the sport is called hypothesis testing.* Now, there are other sorts of things we do in statistics (namely experiments) but we'll get to that later as they're essentially plays and strategies so that you can win (or lose) the game. 

The two pieces we need to cocentrate on is: 
* The Null Hypothesis (often notated as H<sub>o</sub>)
* The Alternate Hypothesis (often notated as H<sub>a</sub>)

But what do these mean? Well, for the most part (as you should know by now and if you don't, pay special attention to the next few words), we make assumptions about a population parameter. That assumption is tentative, not absolute because we honestly can't know for sure, but in the midst and between the tentativeness and actually making that assertion officially (via a report or a paper or a report). Until it reaches that space though, we call it a hypothesis.

But hypotheses in statistics are a little different.

## <a id="hyp"></a> Hypotheses and You

Chapter 9 is all about how hypothesis tests can be conducted about a population mean and a population proportion. We begin by providing examples that illustrate approaches to developing null and alternative hypotheses. 

As a reminder, when we mention population proportions. These are essentially how many people in a population share a certain characteristic. Here, we'll talk about the two hypotheses that we need to consider today: the Null (H<sub>o</sub>) and the Alternate (H<sub>a</sub>). 

#### TLDR: When we write a hypothesis (H<sub>o</sub> or H<sub>a</sub>), we begin or have to end with the inverse of the thing we want to prove (H<sub>o</sub> or H<sub>a</sub>). 

### <a id="null"></a> The Null and You

Your book on page 407 makes this example: 

> Several new fuel injection units will be manufactured, installed in test automobiles, and subjected to research-controlled driving conditions. The sample mean miles per gallon for these automobiles will be computer and used in a hypothesis test to determine whether it can be concluded that the new system provides more than 24 miles per gallon. In terms of the population mean miles per gallon μ, the *research hypothesis* μ > 24 becomes the *alternative hypothesis*. Since the current system provides an average or mean of 24 miles per gallon, we will make the tentative assumption that the new systemis not any better than the current system and choose μ ≤ 24 as the null hypothesis. 

So how we'd write this on a board, in a research report, or in a white paper of some kind is basically: 
* H<sub>o</sub>: μ ≤ 24 
* H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 24

Do you see what these are suggesting? 

* H<sub>o</sub>: μ ≤ 24 

My hope is that you can read this statement from left to right. How do we state this. Well, it's a little like this: 

The null hypothesis in this case would be something like, "The new fuel injection units will get less than or exactly 24 miles per gallon." And this is the essential quality of the null, "there is no effect" or "nothing changed" or "we didn't see a statistically significant shift."

Let's take a look at the alternate hypothesis. At times, we call this a "research hypothesis" though for the purposes of class, the homeworks, and the tests I will only ask you about alternate hypothesis.

### <a id="alternate"></a> What do you mean, Alternate?

We often define the alternate hypothesis as: 

> an theory inverse to the null that a researcher is testing.

We basically cannot really just sit down and write a research statement or a thing we're going to do. Instead, we have to: 
* Think about the data we need to collect.
* Think about how we asked those questions.
* Think about the ethics of what you are doing.

* H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 24

So with the alternate hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>), we can begin or end here. In fact, at times we will be placing H<sub>o</sub> as a challenge to common sense, a challenge to assumptions we all make, or an actual research hypothesis. And so, we write it out in this circumstance. 

And we would say it like this, "The new fuel injection units will get more than 24 miles per gallon." And so, we have this thing we're doing research on. And here's where the details can get you.
