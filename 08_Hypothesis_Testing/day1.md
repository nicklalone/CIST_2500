# Hypothesis Testing - Ho's and Ha's 

In chapters 7 and 8 (last week), we did some work in and around expanding our toolkit. However, we don't really have anything to put all of our tools into. As a result, we have a giant mess to think about. 

We have all this data sitting around. It's raw, it is untamed, and yet all we can do is explore, poke around. 

Well, that is about to change.
