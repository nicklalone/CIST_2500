Another way to think about this week is how we begin to move from description to inferences.

## <a id="tat"></a>Tips and Tricks


## <a id="formulas"></a> Formulas
* **Mean**: $\bar{x} \ or \mu = \frac{\Sigma{x}}{n}$ 
* **Median**: $\frac{N+1}{2}$
* **Mode**: Is simply the most repeated number. 
* Variance / Standard Deviation: 
	* **Population** = $\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma(X-\mu)^2}{N}$ whereas Standard Deviation is: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X-\mu)^2}{N}}$
	* **Sample** = $s^2 = \frac{\Sigma(X-\bar{x})^2}{N}$ whereas Standard Deviation is: $s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X-\bar{x})^2}{N}}$

## <a id="ts"></a> Example 1: Test Scores
Every test, homework, assignment, quiz, or other kind of skill check is useful for understanding a few different things. For example, if the scores are all low, then looking more into the questions that were missed the most can be useful to see if it was your lectures or the outside reading that matters. If the test is super high, then either you're doing a good job or you're not pushing your students hard enough but this is a delicate thing so it can be tricky to get right. 

Data from Test 1: 
85, 95, 42, 80, 100, 100, 100, 85, 67, 10, 78, 54, 99, 100, 85, 85, 85, 66, 42, 69, 87, 85, 85, 99, 20

We need to get these data into Excel and so let's try that out.

We also need to get some summary statistics, let's try those out.

## <a id="hp"></a>Example 2: House Prices
House prices will tend to influence how people perceive a neighborhood. And so, we are going to start an analysis of home prices in a neighborhood...somewhere?

130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;250,000;873,879;450,000;234,000;132,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;133,000; 145,000; 257,000; 360,999;130,000; 147,000; 357,000; 365,999;130,500; 145,000; 259,000; 360,999;130,000; 145,000; 257,000; 367,999;250,400;873,879;451,000;234,000;130,000; 145,000; 57,000; 368,999;130,700; 145,000; 257,000; 367,999;130,000; 145,000; 157,000; 360,999;130,300; 145,000; 257,000; 360,989;130,000; 145,000; 457,000; 360,999;258,500;873,879;450,000;234,000;25,000;

## <a id="sr"></a>Example 3: Speedrun Times
I really enjoy watching folks speedrun games and lately, i've been enamored with Ninja Gaiden 2 which is a game I worked really hard at beating when I was a kid and was the first game I ever finished. 

The world record of this game can be found at: https://www.speedrun.com/ng2nes?h=Any&x=vdo4e92p

The current times I have achieved are: 
00:14:54,00:12:24,00:24:51,00:34:04,00:15:14,00:19:34,00:40:04,00:24:24,00:34:19,00:19:15,00:30:59,00:22:22,00:18:16,00:16:00,01:12:14,00:54:04,00:24:18,00:29:34,00:22:33
